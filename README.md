# Conquering Responsive Layouts

A 21 days challenge on responsive layout by Kevin Powell

### Challenge 1

```INSTRUCTIONS

 - Limit the total width of the .intro-conent to about half of it's parent
 - Stop the text from overflowing out the bottom at small screen widths
 - You may modify the HTML if needed

```

### Challenge 2

```INSTRUCTIONS
 - Keep the text inside .intro-content in the same place, but have the background extend from one side of the viewport to the other, no matter how wide or narrow the browser is.
 - Limit the maximum width of the text in the bottom area.
 - You may modify the HTML if needed (you probably should for this challenge)

```
